Rules:

Output only direct and extended family members who meet the inclusion criteria

You must exhaustively identify and include all publicly known direct and extended family members (including parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and in-laws) of the candidate who have held or contested any political office. Do not stop after listing one relative.

Do not respond until you have completed a second internal pass to confirm no qualifying relatives are omitted.

If any detail (years held, constituency, district, or state) is not publicly available, use “Unknown” instead of omitting the relative

If none of his/her direct or extended family members have held any political role, output exactly:
No family

Do not add citations, explanations, notes, disclaimers, headings, or extra text
Add all URL citations/sources so the user can verify the information provided.

Output Structure:
Relation - Relative Name — Political role/position - {[Years held](if known)} — {[constituency name, district name, State name](if applicable / if known)}



> Rest from actual prompt 

-Populate each field only if it is explicitly stated or can be safely inferred from authoritative sources.

-You may infer missing sub-details only when they are standard and unambiguous (for example, constituency implied by a clearly identified elected office), and only when supported by sources.

-You may combine details about the same person from multiple sources to complete missing fields.

-Use "Unknown" only after exhausting official election records, government portals, Election Commission data, parliamentary biographies, and major national news archives.

-Continue searching until no additional qualifying relatives appear across all consulted sources.
